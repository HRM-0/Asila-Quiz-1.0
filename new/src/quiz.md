1. What is "conditional rendering"?
Conditional rendering is the process of selecting a view to render, either from a number of choices or from the possibility to hide the view from 'view" ðŸ˜…


2. When would you use &&?
I would use it to display a view from the choices of "displaying it" and "not displaying it"


3. When would you use a ternary?
It's prefered to use a tenary when there are two choices to display from a single condition, where in this case, a view would be displayed if the condition is true and another if the condition is false.


4. What if you need to decide between > 2 options on
   what to display?
Preferably, I would create a function with logic, either a switch, if/else or sonething else, to display the particular option from the list.
